To run wowadmin you must specify your servers locations inside the script and set the proper names.

The reason i use "oldname" and "newname" for worlserver binary is because you might want to run more then 1 realm, then you set up 2 wowadmin.sh clones, same authserver config, but different worldserver path and "newnames". This will make multirealming on linux very simple.
